      <h3><b>Mono Red Gift Goblins in Baltimore</b></h3>

    <p><b>Mono-Red Gift Golbins is one of the strongest decks in the format</b></p>
        <p>After a hot recommendation from Ben Friedman, I decided to give Mono-Red Gift Goblins a try. On paper, this deck looks like a clunky pile of red cards, haphazardly thrown together but when played, it turns into a nasty red deck with the possibility to win any match-up.<p>
        <p>Being one of the best decks in standard is not something that happens overnight.  Golbin gifts is on the verge of becoming just that.  This deck is in its early stages of development but a few tweaks here and there can drastically improve the deck's capabilities.  Having the ability to win without Gate or God-Pharaoh's gift is a huge leg up that the mono-red variant can boast compared to its other colored counterparts.  Mono-red also presents EXPLOSIVE starts with Skirk Prospector essentially ramping you one mana for the turn as well as a gate trigger.  Another upside to this deck is its transformative sideboard.  In match-ups like white black vehicles, I take out all the "combo pieces" and replace them with solid red cards like Rekindling Pheonix and Glorybringer.</p>
        <p>One thing that I would change about the deck-list I played is to remove the 4 Rowdy Crew and replace them with 2 Willy Goblins and 2 Chandra, Torch of Defiance.  Rowdy Crew was by far the worst card in the deck, I took it out almost every single round.  The card didn't play well in a combo deck; I found myself casting Rowdy Crew, discarding one of my relevant combo pieces and losing horrendously after casting a 4 mana 3/3.  Chandra was an overperformer for me; extra mana, a must kill threat and extra cards.  With the format being pretty hostile to Vraska's contempt, its time for Chandra to shine again.</p>
    <p><h4><b>Sideboarding Guide</b></h4></p>
    <p><b>Against Control</b></p>    
      <p>Against Control, it is extremely important to get threats down as early as possible.  Skirk Prospector into an early Chandra almost always win you the game.  The one card you should worry about is Lyra, creatures with 5 or more toughness are extremely difficult to deal with.  You can kinda play around settle by exerting Combat Celebrant for an extra combat step.  Casting important must counter cards when your opponent has 4 mana makes their game plan a lot less efficient.  Once you fall behind, it becomes extremely difficult to win.  </p>

      <p>+3 Chandra, Torch of Defiance, +3 Glorybringer, +2 Hour of Devastation</p>
    <p><b>Against Mid-range</b></p>
      <p>Against mid-range decks, I like to take out all the "combo pieces" and board in efficient red creatures that are explosive and hard to deal with.  This really is where the transformative side-board strategy comes into play, all 15 of the sideboard cards go into the main post board.  Creatures with 1 toughness are bad against these types of decks since most of them are running walking ballista.  Abrade is a must have to kill their vehicles and important artifacts, so don't waste your abrades on non-essential creatures.  You can usually set up sweet attacks by following up with Goblin Chainwhirler post-combat.  Last but not least, always kill their turn 1 mana dork... Please.</p>

      <p>+your whole sideboard</p>
    <p><b>Against Red Aggro</b></p>
      <p>Against aggro, game one is fairly easy, your creatures are efficient and they aren't running abrade to stop your gifts combo.  Some of their creatures get brick walled by your chainwhirlers and their late game pre-boarded, isn't something you should be scared of.  Gate is also a very useful tool cycling you through your draws as well as gaining you life, negating the early pressure the red deck has.  Post-board on the other hand, the match-up becomes a bit more complicated.  They have creatures like harsh mentor and spells like abrade to interact with your combo.  They also take out their "bad" creatures and replace them for better ones that are more threatening thoughout the game.  I would prioritize your removal on thier vehicles, harsh mentor, and kari zev.</p>
