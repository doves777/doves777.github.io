     <p><b>I almost quit magic today...</b></p>
    <p>That’s sort of a bold statement to start this post with, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t true. In my mind, I believed there would never be a breaking point within a tournament that would lead me to this thought. No matter the amount of variance, bad matchups, or misplays from my part I was sure that I would come out of a tournament ready (and honestly excited) to play the next one.</p>
    <p>That was until I was forced out of today’s tournament by a juggernaut.</p>
    <p>For those of you who don’t know the story, I’ll give a brief explanation here – but I’d rather not dwell. My teammate Andrew made a small mistake within a game; he forgot to attack with a juggernaut in a board where it would have been unfavored to. That’s the gist of the mistake, there are more details, but yeah he forgot to attack with a juggernaut. This led to a judge call which resulted in a disqualification for suspected cheating.</p>
    <p>If you know Andrew, you know this is preposterous. He can occasionally be a little careless and forget stupid things, but he is definitely not a cheater. He takes the game very seriously and wants to win only by legitimate means.</p>
    <p>After this judge call, which in my opinion was handled extremely poorly by the head judge, I was at 0. I’m not sure what 0 means to you, but to me, it is the absolute feeling of loss, hopelessness, and despair. It is a state of emotion that has 0 elation, 0 reasons to believe in a brighter future, and 0 reasons to go on. 0 is a state I have rarely been in my life. Even at points where I’ve felt I’ve had unfair judge calls that resulted in huge tournament disappointments, this time was different. For the past few team GPs, our team hadn’t been doing well. This time though, we started out 3-0, which meant a lot. Falling from this emotional high down to a 0 was...well there isn’t really a word that could capture it.</p>
    <p>However, despite being at 0… I might be at 100 now. This post ends on a happy note, and not by anything I’ve done, but by everything you all have done.</p>
    <p>The number of people that walk up to Andrew and I and send their condolences was staggering. Every single person took the time to hear our vents, sympathize with our frustrations, and try to help us get restituted for the day’s events. One of the fears I have, when I make friends through magic, connections don’t exist. If we were outside this tournament hall, you wouldn’t talk to me. When we play, I’m just a match result and a face to tie that result. But I seriously learned today that is far from the truth.</p>
    <p>I started at 0, but now I’m at 100. This disqualification has without a doubt meant more to me than any tournament so far, and I’m not sure if a tournament will ever come close. I’m so grateful to have every single one of you in my life, and I thank you all for continuing to support me and my team. Hopefully, justice will be served and this disqualification will invoke change, I know it already has for me personally, but I will see to it that we will come out of this stronger and better than ever.</p>
    <p>Looking to the future, I plan to continue to play magic without a doubt. I’m excited to drop the next tournament of my own accord, or hey maybe lucksack my way through. Good luck to all of my friends in the upcoming events, this has been quite a rollercoaster ride, but I’m still not ready to get off.</p>
