      <p>Magic the Gathering is a difficult game, a game with changing variables with new cards and interactions keeping players on their feet.  I was hooked the first day I played.  For about two years I’ve been studying the game and I’ve implemented a learning philosophy that has accelerated my learning and results.</p>
      <p>From my first GP at DC2017 to now (2019), I've been to two Pro Tours and placed in many high-level tournaments across the country.  I can attribute to my success to a learning philosophy known as Shu Ha Ri (しゅはり), or obey digress transcend. </p>
      <h5>Moving Parts of Shu Ha Ri</h5>
      <p><b>Shu</b></p>
      <p>
        To obey: learning fundamentals, techniques, and heuristics</p>
      <p>
        Truly understanding the fundamentals of the game is the key to mastery.  When first learning the game, dedicate yourself to learning the fundamentals and applying common heuristics to the game. (Ex. bolt the bird)  There are plenty of resources online that can help with this process.  Reid Duke’s Level One course and Patrick Chapin’s Next Level Magic helped solidify Magic fundamentals that would have taken me years to figure out on my own.  There is no shortcut through this process, dedicate a little time each day studying these fundamentals and you will be surprised at how much you will improve.  This step took me about a year of studying until I was able to recall “what the book says”.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process is also crucial when picking up a new deck; understanding why each card belongs in the deck and what sideboard options are good when is indispensable.  A sideboard guide can help with this process but do not rely too heavily on it without thinking for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ha</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        To digress: innovation and thinking outside the box
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you reach this stage, congratulations! This is when Magic gets exciting.  Once you understand why you are doing something, your playbook expands to your creativity and imagination.  Innovation based off of reasoning is what separates the good from the great.  Understanding fundamentals give you the flexibility to make unique lines that are correct.  To train in this step, I found it very helpful to play with other people who you believe are also at this level.  You will quickly find that a line that you thought was the correct play isn’t the only correct play in a situation.  I also found it useful to watch people stream.  It provides a very similar atmosphere to playing alongside a partner, but its major downside is you can’t immediately probe the streamers mind when you have a question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ri</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        To transcend: there are no techniques, the game is natural, becoming one with the cards, blessed with the heart of the cards
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have hit this stage, you’ve become a master.  The Reid Dukes, the LSVs, the Ben Starks, of magic live and breath the game.  These players play their way; the plays they make are born from imagination and years of experience.  If you ever have the opportunity to play against someone in this stage, you are in for a very good game of Magic.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h5>Good Luck</h5>
      <p>Stepping through the right process of improving when first learning the game is crucial to achieving long term success.  Studying fundamentals diligently will build a solid foundation for the rest of your game to stand on.  Good luck on your journey, and see you in top 8.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br>Andrew</p>
