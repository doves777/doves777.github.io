    <p><b>Round 1 and 2:</b></p>
        <p>Byes XD</p>
    <p><b>Round 3 R/G Monsters (1-1):</b></p>
        <p>First time ever playing U/B midrange. I was a bit slow in going through the flow and triggers of the deck; the opponent also played fairly slowly.  Game 1 I was not able to stabilize with the opponent attacking with two glorybringers.  Game 2 I stabilized at 5 health behind a wall of Scarab God tokens while slowly draining his life total until the opponent's life total fell to zero.  </p>
    <p><b>Round 4 R/G Monsters (2-1):</b></p>
        <p>Game 1 ended up being, I removed your early creature, I play Scarab God on turn 5, I win.  Reanimated his Earthshaker Khenra and attacked through his single Phoenix.  Game 2, I was a bit stuck on mana and only had 4 lands at turn 6. I was able to remove two of his phoenixs but his jadelight ranger and glorybringer finished me off before I could deploy a threat.  Game 3, I was fortunate to have an early glint-sleeve and athersphere harvester which bought me enough time to deploy a scarab god and close the game out.  The opponent used a struggle too early on the aethersphere harvester and lost to a scarab god the very next turn.   </p>
    <p><b>Round 5 Mono-Red aggro (2-0):</b></p>
        <p>I don't know how he ended up in the draw bracket.  Both games he was not able to apply enough pressure early enough and scarab god on turn 5 won me the games.  The opponent ended up doing really well at the tournament ending at a record of 11-3-1.  I imagine his success was due to a unique card he played instead of ahn-crop crasher.  The opponent was playing Brazen Scourge, a 3 mana 3/3 with haste from Kaladesh.  This card is fairly difficult to remove with traditional mono-red hate like moment of craving and magma spray.  Diminishing the value of the opponents' removal spells likely carried him to a solid finish. </p>
    <p><b>Round 6 R/G Monsters (0-2):</b></p>
        <p>Game 1 I was not able to beat his turn 6 carnage tyrant and lost to him pumping it with hashep oasis despite having a reasonable board state.  Game 2 the opponent was able to deploy a lifecrafter's bestiary turn 3 and turn 4 and despite getting him to 3, I was not able to top deck a walking ballista for lethal and was buried under an immense card advantage bestiary provided.</p>
    <p><b>Round 7 R/G Monsters (2-0):</b></p>
        <p>Game 1 the opponent was not able to deal with my main-board gifted aetherborn and scarab god.  Game 2 was a close game.  He was able to remove my first scarab god and deployed a carnage tyrant the next turn.  I was able to stabilize with two gifted aetherborns until the opponent top-decked phoenix and glorybringer. The opponent was able to get me down to 1 life before I eventually overtook him with a reanimated champion into scarab god.  The opponent missed some damage by not attacking with his carnage tyrant through my gifted aetherborn which ended up costing him the game.</p>
    <p><b>Round 8 B/R Aggro (2-0):</b></p>
        <p>Last round of day 1.  Game 1 the opponent noticed a sideboard card in his opener and had to mull to six.  I sensed that he was afraid of mulling down to five.  He did not have any play until turn 4 when he played a phoenix that I contempted.  Game 2, he did not have a turn 1 or turn 2 play.  I played a walking ballista for 1 on turn 2 and on my opponents turn 3 he cast a dispossess naming walking ballista.  Needless to say, I won that game, putting me into day two.</p>
    <p><b>Round 9 U/W Cycling (0-2):</b></p>
        <p>The first round of day two and the opponent happened to be a poker/magic grinder.  Game 1 I was unable to put enough pressure early and was settled twice.  He ended up killing me with drake haven tokens.  Game 2, I was settled 3 times and I lost XD.  The opponent made a very crucial play when he only had 5 lands in play.  I went to field of ruin his land, he floated mana and casted a gearhulk for no value.  That gearhulk ended up swinging 4 times for 20 damage and I was dead, no drake haven needed.</p>
    <p><b>Round 10 Mastermind Ramp (2-0):</b></p>
        <p>Mastermind Ramp is bad, after negating his one win condition I won the game.  The deck did a lot of nothing, its problem lies in its easy to answer win conditions.</p>
    <p><b>Round 11 Grixis Midrange (2-0):</b></p>
        <p>Both game 1 and 2 I was able to out value my opponent.  He drew more removal spells while I drew more creatures that interacted with the board state.  I am a fan of taking out all my fatal pushes against these kinds of decks.</p>
    <p><b>Round 12 U/B Midrange (0-2):</b></p>
        <p>Lost the mirror, both game 1 and 2 were really close.  The opponent was able to cleanly answer my scarab god while deploying multiple of his own.  Both games came down to who's scarab god stuck.</p>
    <p><b>Round 13 Grixis Midrange (2-1):</b></p>
        <p>I definitely feel that u/b midrange has a slight advantage over grixis midrange.  The cards in my deck were better than his magama sprays and harnessed lightning.  Game 1, I was on the play and was able to do on the play things like drawing extra cards with glint-sleeve which buried the opponent under card advantage.  Game 2, I wasn't able to answer his double glint sleeve and virtuoso.  Game 3, I was able to bury him in virtual card advantage.  The opponent drew magma sprays and harnessed lightnings while I drew lilianas and scarab gods.</p>
    <p><b>Round 14 U/B Midrange (2-0):</b></p>
        <p>Game 1 and 2 were both very close games.  I was able to squeak out the win game 1 after top decking a gearhulk to flashback a contempt in order to kill his scarab god.  Game 2 was super grinding.  The game took about 30 minutes with the game going back and forth.  The opponent was playing search of azcanta along with a turn 2 blood fast which allowed him to come back from his inital disadvantage position.  I was able to attack with a 2/1 champion of the wits for 5 turns with both of us holding up mana waiting for someone to make the first move.  This allowed me to draw more cards off of my blood fast which resulted in me drawing my river's rebuke to win the game.</p>
    <p><b>Round 15 Grixis Midrange (2-0):</b></p>
        <p>I drew really well in both Game 1 and 2.  The weakness of grixis against u/b pre-boarded is the larger amount of removal spells it has in its main.  I was naturally able to draw more threats than the opponent to eventually win Game 1.  Game 2, the game got to a point where he had a glint sleeve with 0 energy and a chandra while I had no cards in hand. The opponent drew land,magma spray, virtuoso, while I drew scarab god, liliana, gearhulk.</p>
    <p>Overall, I am happy with my finish and min cash, but a bit sad that I couldn't top 8.  This tournament pushed me up to 6 pro points, more than half-way to a bronze level pro :).  The next tournament I will be attending is GP Hartford probably playing Mardu Pyromancer.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading this tournament report, hope you found it engaging and helpful.  This will be the first of many to come!! --Andrew</p>
