    <p><b>I played a one-game tournament this weekend.</b></p>
    <p>Every single match is a combination of single tournament games that combine into a final result.  That final result isn’t the focus of any of the games, playing to the best of my capabilities is my singular goal.  When I use to play professional golf, I adopted the philosophy of taking one shot at a time.  I translated this thought and applied it to each game of Magic the Gathering I play.  How I performed on my last shot does not determine how I will perform in the future.  Most people’s tournament experience is a cumulative experience when instead should be a secular experience.  I can attribute my recent success to this tournament winning philosophy.  </p>
    <p>People want to actualize their results but become too focused on the result instead of the process.  The equity of time spent in the game itself is being capitalized by worries of the future instead of focusing on the game itself.  Reid Duke had a similar statement in a podcast with him and Marshal Sutcliffe where he said: “the moment when you start picturing yourself with the trophy, is the moment it falls apart.”  Victory is not what the game is about, our focus should be on making the perfect play.  We are going to win the game when we win the game.  The effects of winning or losing the game should be negligible to us during the game.  This is what Reid Duke means when talking about the trophy.  That penultimate goal of winning the tournament should be completely separated from the game we are playing.</p>
    <p>Our emotions should not dictate our gameplay.  Harnessing our emotions to create intuitive conclusions about the game is a great use of our game-time.  The goal isn’t to blank out our emotions, we are all human.  We have this incredible intuition built into our subconscious that tells us when a situation is becoming dire or becoming favorable. This intuition is our mind processing information available to us; time spent blocking this out for fear that it will poorly impact our game is time spent poorly.</p>
    <p>When we feel sad, stressed, or angry during a game, we should explore the reasons to the feeling.  What about the game is manifesting these emotions.  How can we alter the game to a state where there is no more negative emotions?  The same is true for the opposite; when we are elated, excited, or overjoyed about a game state, what is causing these emotions?  What about the game is manifesting these feelings and how can these feelings be maintained?</p>
    <p>Focusing on each game, play by play is an important way to drastically increase performance at tournaments.  It is important to look internally at our emotions throughout the game as well as between matches and approach matches holistically.  Humans are designed to feel emotions, both positive and negative.  As beings who are affected by these emotions, we should harness them and use them to our benefit.  These are the important realizations I went through after playing years of competitive golf and these realizations have tremendously quickened my performance in the Magic scene.  Keeping my mind free from results, focusing on perfecting each play, engaging my feelings throughout the match and extract realizations from them are my strategies I employ, one game at a time.</p>
